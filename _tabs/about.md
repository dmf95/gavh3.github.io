Hey there!

If you've made it this far, you might know a few things about me already. Namely:
- I love dark mode
- RuneScape played a part during my childhood
- My name is Gavin He

Now, I should probably mention that I am also a Data professional. I work at [Best Buy Canada](https://www.bestbuy.ca) as a Senior Data Analyst. My work is mainly focused on improving our fulfillment network by means of optimization (such as automation, machine learning, building data tools). Within the Analytics community, I like using the term *full-stack* to describe what I do. I've worn many hats - from regular data analysis to enable decisions, automating the text classification of our customer experience survey data for PowerBI dashboards, to parallelizing the hyperparameter tuning of a machine learning pipeline.

Formally, I graduated with a Business degree with a focus in data analytics. I enjoy embrancing the unknown and welcome new technical challenges. I started this site to document my learning journey, one post or project at a time ðŸ“š
